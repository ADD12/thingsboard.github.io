#### Overview

Edge Queues are designed in the same way, as [Platform (Cloud) Queues](/docs/{{cloudDocsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/queues/).
Please read Platform Queues documentation to get knowledge on Queues functionality.

#### Propagation Queues to Edge

All the Queues, that are created on the Platform, are automatically propagated to every Edge instance, that is connected to the Platform. 
No additional assignment actions required from Tenant administrator or user.

#### Queues Usage in the Rule Engine

Tenant administrator is able to use any Queue in the Edge Rule Chain(s), in the same way as it used for Core Rule Chain(s).
No additional actions required.
