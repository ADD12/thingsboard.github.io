As part of this solution, we have provided a Swimming Pool SCADA system dashboard to visualize and interact with the data from multiple devices. This dashboard allows you to:

- Water Quality Management: Monitors water levels and pH filters to maintain optimal conditions.
- Temperature Control: Utilizes data from outdoor and pool temperature sensors to intelligently control heat pumps, maintaining desired water temperatures efficiently.
- Equipment Monitoring: Tracks the performance of pumps and filtration systems by monitoring flow rates, vibration levels, power consumption, and rotational speeds.
- Valve Control: Remotely manages the flow through various pump segments by controlling multiple valves, enhancing the flexibility and responsiveness of the system.
- Energy Management: Measures and manages the energy usage of key components like heat pumps and filtration systems, providing opportunities to optimize energy consumption and reduce operational costs.
- Remote System Management: Enables operators to remotely alter system states, such as turning systems on or off, switching between operational modes, and controlling valves, enhancing convenience and response times.
