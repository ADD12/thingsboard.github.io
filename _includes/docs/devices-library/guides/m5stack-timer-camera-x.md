[M5Stack Timer Camera X](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-cameras/products/esp32-psram-timer-camera-x-ov3660) is a camera module based on ESP32, integrated with ESP32 chip and 8M-PSRAM.  
The camera (OV3660) with 3 million pixels, DFOV 66.5° and shoot 2048x1536 resolution photo, built-in 140mAh battery and LED status indicator, featuring ultra-low power consumption design.  
There is a reset button under the LED. It is possible to realize sleep and wake-up timing through RTC (BM8563). The standby current is only 2μA.  
In this guide, we will discuss how to connect the ESP32-based boards to ThingsBoard.
