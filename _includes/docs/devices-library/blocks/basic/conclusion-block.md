With the knowledge outlined in this guide, you can easily connect your {{deviceName}} and send data to ThingsBoard. From now on you can move forward and send any data that you want.
  
You can further process the data in the [rule chains](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/re-getting-started) on ThingsBoard, as well as [create alarms](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/tutorials/create-clear-alarms) and the necessary logic.   
For more advanced data analysis, you can use [ThingsBoard Trendz](/docs/trendz/).
