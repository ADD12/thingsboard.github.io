Firstly, you have to have Python installed on your OrangePI, we recommend using python 3.9 as a mainstream python version, if you havenâ€™t installed Python, you can do it by the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3 git python3-pip
```

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 1
```

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.5 2
```
{:.copy-code}

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config python
```

Also, you should have installed thingsboard-python-client-sdk which can be installed using the following command. Still, we recommend installing packages outside the global environment (we will do it in step 3):

```bash
pip3 install tb-mqtt-client board digitalio
```

And you have to have tools that allow editing code, for example, you can use Nano editor that is going out of the box or install any other code edit you are familiar with.
