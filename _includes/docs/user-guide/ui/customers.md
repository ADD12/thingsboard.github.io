## Introduction

A Customer is a separate business entity, individual, or organization that purchases or uses tenant devices and assets. The Customer may have multiple users and millions of devices and assets.

[Tenant administrators](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/tenants/) can create customers and can directly manage their [users](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/users/), [assets](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/assets/), [devices](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/devices/),
[dashboards](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/), and [edges](/docs/edge/) from the customer details page by clicking the related tab.

### Create new customer

As a Tenant administrator, you can add a new Customer using the following steps.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="add-new-customer" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Edit customer

The Tenant administrator can edit the title, specify a home dashboard and edit the rest of the fields for this customer. 
Letâ€™s see how to do this:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="edit-customer" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Delete customer

The tenant administrator can delete a customer using one of the following ways:

First way:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Second way:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-2" showListImageTitles="true" %}

You can also delete multiple customers at once.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="delete-customer-3" showListImageTitles="true" %}
