4. Tenant administrators can directly **manage users, assets, devices, dashboards, and edges** from the Customer details page by clicking the related tab. 
The tenant administrator can also copy the customer ID from these details. All the information can be edited by clicking the pencil icon.
Tenant can optionally assign the home dashboard and select the toolbar's visibility in Customer details.

If you have questions, you can also click the Question mark in the upper right corner, and you will be redirected to the user guide.
