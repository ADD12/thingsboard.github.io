## Tenants overview

ThingsBoard supports [Multitenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) out-of-the-box.
You can treat ThingsBoard Tenant as a separate business-entity: individual or organization who owns or produces devices.

The **System administrator** is able to create one or more tenant entities.
Tenant may have multiple tenant administrator users and enormous number of customers, devices and assets.

### Adding a Tenant 

To add a new **Tenant**, please follow the instructions below:

Select **Tenants** from the menu on the left. Then, click plus icon to add a new Tenant.
