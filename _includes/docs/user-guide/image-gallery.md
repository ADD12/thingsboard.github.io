The Image gallery serves as a centralized repository for storing and managing images. This is an important resource for improving the visual appeal and functionality of widgets, dashboards, devices, and asset profiles in a mobile application. 
Users can easily upload, organize, and select images to customize their interface and user experience, ensuring an integrity and branded look across the platform.

## Managing image gallery

Learn about the image gallery interface to identify the functionalities of various features.

The toolbar in the Image Gallery provides options to [upload images](#upload-image), [toggle between list and grid viewing modes](#change-the-image-view-mode), [filter system images](#system-images), search for images by name, and refresh the display, all accessible through specific icons on the toolbar.

### Add image

You can add your images to the Image gallery serves in [image file format](#upload-image) (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) or [JSON file format](#import-image).

#### Upload image

To upload your images in **image file format**, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="upload-image-1" showListImageTitles="true" %}

#### Import image

To import your images in **JSON file format**, follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="upload-image-2" showListImageTitles="true" %}

### Change the image view mode

To change the image viewing mode, simply select one of the two modes in the top left corner of the Image gallery window: an image list or an image grid.
